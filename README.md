# Accelerating the Convolutional Layer
Accelerator for a Convolutional Layer written in Verilog. For SCU ELEN249, taught by Kiran Gunnam.

## Deliverables

1. Implement all the 3 approaches listed in the paper (Code 1, Code 2 and Code 3) in MATLAB.

 **completed in ./matlab/ folder**

2. Model the core part of the hardware accelerator (as shown in Fig 7 of the paper for the convolutional layer with unroll factor <64,7> in MATLAB and Verilog . Both should match.

3. Model the DRAM access patterns for the input and output for all the 3 approaches in MATLAB.
